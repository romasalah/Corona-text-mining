# Corona-text-mining
This will be my trial to text mine thousands of research articles related to COVID19 virus.

 I'm not an expert in text mining, natural language processing or deep learning. I will provide all the data and code. 

# dataset
a combiation of 9000 research article that contanin certain keywords related to corona virus. each article is divided into metadata(title and author),abstract,body, 

Note: because of the overlap between "coronary artery" and "corona", excpect to see some "coronary article" research articles in the original dataset, I tried to filter them as much as possible in the preprocessed dataset.
